15.72,16.89,I see your face
16.94,18.63,Everywhere that I go
18.73,20.55,On the clouds in the sky
20.64,23.03,On the faces of strangers
23.03,24.26,The birds sing your name
24.38,26.11,And the fish try to talk
26.20,28.01,'Cause without you the world
28.09,30.28,Would be too dark to matter
30.49,31.94,You're like the sun

33.74,35.60,But your light shines on

37.54,39.52,When you're not around
39.82,43.01,You make it worthwhile to expect you

45.44,46.72,You turn on a switch
46.84,48.83,And the gloom is gone
49.25,50.59,You gave me my life
50.74,52.77,And you carry on

78.70,81.13,For my own selfish reasons
81.19,82.51,You paint my sky blue
82.51,84.26,And you spin my earth 'round
