14.63,17.58,Tears are like diamonds in my eyes
17.98,21.10,Blind me so now you're out of sight
21.43,26.43,"It's enough, it's too late to break this silence"
28.28,31.38,In a rose-coloured view of us
31.72,34.79,"I got lost, could I realize"
35.16,38.29,All your lies would be blades and knives
38.67,40.33,To stab me inside
40.76,44.04,Who will save you from this dark?
44.16,47.23,Who will fix your selfish heart?
47.40,50.51,"A one way street, that's how you live"
50.75,54.30,Why do you always take and never give?
83.14,86.15,"Wide awake, yeah, I've crossed the line"
86.20,87.22,I'm coming home
87.22,89.57,I'm running back to real life
89.99,90.89,Through the start
91.06,94.81,"Where I could breathe in freely, baby"
95.75,97.74,Can't you see we ran off time
97.95,104.42,Chasin' happiness while you get what you need (get what you need)
102.83,106.32,There's nothing left of us but bleeding blades and knives
106.32,109.04,Tonight you'll know how it feels
109.04,112.33,"A one way street, that's how you live"
112.49,115.81,Why do you always take and never give?
115.94,119.16,I'll walk away to help you see
119.39,122.68,Our love is rolling down so easily
122.84,124.83,A one way street
153.24,154.78,<nl> (Oh-oh-oh) </nl>
155.18,158.82,"A one way street (oh, you're a one way street)"
158.51,162.72,"You never give (oh, you're a one way street)"
162.03,165.70,"I'll walk away (oh, you're a one way street)"
165.34,169.61,"So easily (oh, you're a one way street)"
