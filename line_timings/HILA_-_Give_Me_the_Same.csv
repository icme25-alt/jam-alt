18.62,19.87,Lay awake at night
20.84,22.13,Wondering how could I
23.02,24.42,Let it get this way
27.46,28.66,Through all the pain
29.48,30.88,I took all the blame
31.94,33.42,While you cursed my last name
36.19,37.86,I thought we could get better
38.45,40.10,Stayed committed like a soldier
40.97,42.31,Believed we're okay
44.42,49.46,Now I know that you don't care
50.48,52.56,At all
53.57,54.83,Time wasted
55.24,60.98,Gave all of my soul and my heart to someone that would never
61.11,62.14,(Give me the same)
62.52,69.60,I was a fool to believe that you would finally be the one to
69.95,71.12,(Give me the same)
71.29,74.63,Heartbroken now
75.79,79.04,How you let me down
79.64,85.19,"But somehow, deep down, I still do"
86.00,88.37,Love you
91.89,93.36,Now you're out all night
94.46,95.70,Telling your lies
96.29,97.80,About the way I hurt you
98.42,99.82,They couldn't see the way
100.69,102.51,You made me feel ashamed
103.06,105.16,For choosing to love you
107.44,108.98,I began to see clearer
109.87,111.15,That you were just a liar
112.12,113.78,Stuck in your ways
115.33,120.37,So now I choose to walk away
121.74,124.13,Forever
124.66,125.94,Time wasted
126.34,131.98,Gave all of my soul and my heart to someone that would never
132.21,133.38,(Give me the same)
133.55,140.74,I was a fool to believe that you would finally be the one to
141.17,142.27,Give me the same
142.54,145.87,Heartbroken now
146.89,150.14,How you let me down
150.83,156.10,"But somehow, deep down, I still do"
157.13,159.41,Love you
160.59,166.74,"How could you just throw it all away, babe"
165.26,168.96,(How could you throw it all away)
169.23,173.75,"I stayed with you through all the lies and pain, oh"
173.94,177.48,"(Through all the lies and pain, oh)"
177.94,182.48,Tears roll down my eyes (down my eyes)
182.48,184.72,As I now realize
186.58,191.98,Your love was never truly mine
192.65,195.81,At all
195.81,197.28,Time wasted
197.49,203.25,Gave all of my soul and my heart to someone that would never
203.34,204.74,(Give me the same)
204.74,211.93,I was a fool to believe that you would finally be the one to
212.21,213.42,(Give me the same)
213.51,218.46,Heartbroken now (heartbroken now)
218.02,221.56,How you let me down (oh)
221.93,227.84,"But somehow, deep down, I still do"
228.30,230.55,Love you
