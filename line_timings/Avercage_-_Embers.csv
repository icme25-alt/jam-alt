32.45,34.10,Through days of thunders
34.26,40.10,Continuing stolid smiles to wear
40.55,42.44,We're going on
43.04,46.98,We nearly carried it to the end
47.32,48.88,And every whisper
49.06,54.91,And every beat of windy heart
55.30,57.39,We're holding on
57.76,64.33,For the moment when we unite
64.51,66.06,No face
66.06,69.50,Is seen at dusk of a raining day
69.67,71.28,No name
71.66,75.50,Is spoken in a loud voice
75.50,77.37,"Still, still"
77.37,80.12,One day it all
80.36,84.77,"Will gone forever, will gone forever"
84.77,87.47,Don't close your eyes
87.81,95.15,"You'll gone forever, you'll gone forever"
95.15,96.91,Just reach the border
96.91,102.81,To throw your past and go ahead
103.25,105.25,"Hey, light your heart"
105.58,110.74,As we're led by a winding thread
112.47,114.11,No face
114.11,117.51,Is seen at dusk of a raining day
117.51,119.51,No name
119.67,123.51,Is spoken with the loud voice
123.63,125.40,"Still, still"
125.40,128.06,One day it all
128.38,132.82,"Will gone forever, will gone forever"
132.82,135.59,Don't close your eyes
135.83,143.67,"You'll gone forever, you'll gone forever"
169.22,179.27,"And we are one, so I promise"
182.66,189.26,"<nl> Mmm-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah </nl>"
189.26,192.90,One day it all
193.35,199.34,"Will gone forever, will gone forever"
199.67,203.13,Don't close your eyes
203.46,209.13,"You'll gone forever, you'll gone forever"
209.45,213.45,There's no more pain
213.67,215.89,Which lasts forever
216.13,219.67,And never severs
219.67,223.53,Once in the end
223.74,226.15,The flame was rendered
226.15,228.76,But living embers
228.92,230.58,Will burn
