I see your face
Everywhere that I go
On the clouds in the sky
On the faces of strangers

The birds sing your name
And the fish try to talk
'Cause without you the world
Would be too dark to matter

You're like the sun
You're so far away
But your light shines on
And brightens each day
When you're not around
You make it worthwhile to expect you

You're like the sun
You turn on a switch
And the gloom is gone
You gave me my life
And you carry on
Without ever wanting a thank you
You're like the sun

Everyone loves you
And wants you around
But it's me most of all
For my own selfish reasons

You paint my sky blue
And you spin my earth 'round
So don't leave me alone
'Cause I can't stand to miss you

You're like the sun
You're so far away
But your light shines on
And brightens each day
When you're not around
You make it worthwhile to expect you

You're like the sun
You turn on a switch
And the gloom is gone
You gave me my life
And you carry on
Without ever wanting a thank you
You're like the sun
