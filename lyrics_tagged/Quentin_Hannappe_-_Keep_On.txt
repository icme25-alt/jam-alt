Keep on working on your dreams and don't run away ( <nl> mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm </nl> )
Keep on following your dreams and don't go astray ( <nl> mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm </nl> )

Searching everywhere for a peace of mind
It's already there, but we cannot find
I keep struggling for my life, but I'm a strong man today
I keep fighting for my rights, so much songs to play

So many problems
So many close friends
And when it's gonna rain
How many gonna stand
So many problems
So many close friends
And when it's gonna rain
How many gonna stand

Keep on working on your dreams and don't run away ( <nl> mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm </nl> )
Keep on following your dreams and don't go astray ( <nl> mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm </nl> )

Sit back and watch what happen those days
How can I relax for the childrens of today
We're smart enough to find our own line
We make art and stuff, but they just stay blind

So many problems
So many close friends
And when it's gonna rain
How many gonna stand
So many problems
So many close friends
And when it's gonna rain
How many gonna stand
