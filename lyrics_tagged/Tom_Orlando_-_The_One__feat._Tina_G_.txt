A time of day
I've been doin' nothing but drinkin' and thinking, yeah-yeah-yeah
Aw, since you been away
Oh, come on

( <nl> Ooh-ooh </nl> ) I don't think that I'm coming back
( <nl> Ooh-ooh-ooh </nl> ) Boy, I told you I'm done with that (come on home, babe)
( <nl> Ooh-ooh </nl> ) You think you can do me so wrong
( <nl> Ooh-ooh-ooh </nl> ) I'm not the one, no

Back in high school (yeah, yeah)
Under the trees
We used to mess around
I'd feel you down
Right there in the streets, damn (yeah)
Those were the days, baby
Now you barely look at me
Like you was never my lady
What has this come to be, shit (come on home, babe)
I guess we grown apart (yeah, yeah)
Went and separated but you still up in my heart
And that will always be the case
You were my first one
No matter how the fuck we split
I wish you nothin' but love (come on home, babe)
But now I'm
Doin' these shows and I'm makin' this money (yeah, yeah)
I'm never stoppin' for these hoes
All want me for money and shit (yeah)
Got these new friends on deck when I cash in my checks
Late up on they rent
Feelin' my heart poppin' outta my chest (come on home, babe)
Ain't no slippin' in this game though (yeah, yeah)
They take advantage just to use you for the clout too
That's why I keep my circle small
And I keep my friends close
Rememberin' to watch my enemies when they come through (come on, babe)
Shit

( <nl> Ooh-ooh </nl> ) I don't think that I'm coming back
( <nl> Ooh-ooh-ooh </nl> ) Boy, I told you I'm done with that (come on home, babe)
( <nl> Ooh-ooh </nl> ) You think you can do me so wrong
( <nl> Ooh-ooh-ooh </nl> ) I'm not the one, no
I'm not the one (come on home)

I feelin' blessed now
I'm finally able to support my momma too
No more double shifts
No more stressin' bout the rent, shit
Complainin' about the hunger and
Goin' to bed starvin'
And it's all thanks to you, momma (come on home, babe)
If it wasn't all for you believin' in me
I'd probably be in jail doin' two to three
You raised me up all on your own
Grew up without my poppa
Hey you put up with my shit
For that you know I'm grateful (come on home, babe, yeah)
Blessed with the family and friends that I have
Got a loving cousin know I got you 'till the end
Shout out to my crew
Adam and Dan, Angelo, Amin and Mack
You know I got your backs (come on home, babe)
Shit, we reppin' Ottawa, Ontario (yeah, yeah)
We up at the Parliament jammin' out all on the radio
I keep my circle small
And I rep my fam' too
Rememberin' to watch our enemies when they comin' through
Shit

(Ooh-ooh) I don't think that I'm coming back
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) Boy, I told you I'm done with that (come on home, babe)
(Ooh-ooh) You think you can do me so wrong
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) I'm not the one, no
I'm not the one

(Oh, babe)
( <nl> Ooh-ooh </nl> ) I don't think that I'm coming back
(I come around no more like that, baby)
( <nl> Ooh-ooh-ooh </nl> ) Boy, I told you I'm done with that
(Done with all that shit, baby, yeah)
( <nl> Ooh-ooh </nl> ) You think you can do me so wrong
(Do me so wrong like)
( <nl> Ooh-ooh-ooh </nl> ) I'm not the one, no
(Not the one, baby)
I'm not the one
(Not the one, baby)

<nl> Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh </nl>

Come on home
Yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah
Come on home, baby
Yeah-yeah
Yeah
Come on
