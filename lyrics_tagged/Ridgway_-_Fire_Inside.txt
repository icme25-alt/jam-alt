I got a lot on my mind
And all of the time
Been tryna do right
I may have lost the light
But I'm keeping it tight
Never give up the fight, no

When my life is a wreck
(When my life is a wreck)
Got to keep it all in check
(I keep it all in check)

Even in the darkest days
Got a trail to blaze
Gonna stick to my ways
I used to be caught in a phase
Where life was a maze
Until I saw the sun's rays

When your life is a wreck
(Life is a wreck)
You got to take the first step, yeah

( <nl> Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh </nl> )
Paddle on through the waves now
( <nl> Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh </nl> )
Gonna take me to that place
( <nl> Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh </nl> )
Find that fire inside
( <nl> Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh </nl> )
It's a fate that you decide

When I feel like I'm losing control
Gotta reach within my soul
And if you're ever feeling low, yeah
You gotta take the first step and go, yeah
Take that first step to the right
Got to find what's inside
Before we run of time, run out of time, run out of time

( <nl> Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh </nl> )
Paddle on through the waves now
( <nl> Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh </nl> )
Gonna take me to that place
( <nl> Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh </nl> )
Find that fire inside
( <nl> Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh </nl> )
It's a fate that you decide
(That you decide)

( <nl> Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh </nl> )
I'm paddling on, I'm paddling strong
( <nl> Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh </nl> )
Find that fire, find that fire
( <nl> Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh </nl> )
I'm paddling on, I'm paddling strong
( <nl> Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh </nl> )
Find that fire, find that fire
Find that fire
Find that fire
Find that fire
