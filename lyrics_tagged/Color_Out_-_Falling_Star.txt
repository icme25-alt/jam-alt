Someday you'll come back here
And you'll open up your arms
And you'll laugh and say I knew it wouldn't take you long
To realize I was gone
And it's only been three years (it's only been three years)
But for me it's been so long (so long, so long)
And I remember it like yesterday
Oh, you could say
I've been holding on (holding on)

And I waited all of my life
For you to make it right
But the time has come and gone
And it's faded and lost all it's light
A star that shined so bright
Falls from the sky

Don't make a wish that won't come true
And I learned that from you
Such a long time ago (long time ago)
When you left you said you had to find
A better way of life
This one just wouldn't do (just wouldn't do)

And I waited all of my life
For you to take your time
To find your place
But I learned that this world still turns without you
And you were just a phase and I learned without you
Here I was happier alone
Then I ever would've known

And so I waited (I waited)
And so I waited (and I waited and I waited)

And so I waited all of my life (all of my life)
For you to take your time (for you to take your time)
But the time has come and gone (and the time has come and gone)
And it's faded and lost all its light
A star that shined so bright
Falls from the sky
On this cold December night
