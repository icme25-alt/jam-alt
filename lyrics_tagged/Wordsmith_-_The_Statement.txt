Live in a time of straight sin
We got black sheep that don't fit in
I'm like, "Huh"
Terrorists who wanna cut limbs
Don't zoom in to my true lens
These loose ends are too grim to just comprehend
I'm like, "Huh"
Oh Lord, it's getting worse
Cops out on that gang turf
Rich folks don't share first
Got planned parents, don't need birth
Got prayers out and don't see church
Hands up and they shoot first
Another young life in that black hearse
I'm too hurt
I'm like, "Huh"

Y'all better come my way
Y'all better come my way, okay, and say
Y'all better come my way
I'ma make a statement day by day

Y'all better come my way
Y'all better come my way, okay, and say
Y'all better come my way
I'ma make a statement day by day

Peace signs, peace signs up
Put 'em in the air, then go rise up (yeah)
Peace signs, peace signs up
Put 'em in the air, then go rise up (yeah)
Peace signs, peace signs up
Put 'em in the air, then go rise up (yeah)
Peace signs, peace signs up
Put 'em in the air, then go rise up (yeah)

Live in a time of true greed
We got kids here who can't write and read
I'm like, "Huh"
Disgust for that mistrust
Say one word and you're handcuffed
Don't call bluff and you'll get struck
And you're in court
Like, "Huh"
Live life with no limits
My way, no gimmicks
Pro league, no scrimmage
Crunch time and I finish
I'm that superstar, no blemish
I just own this, no tenant
You that background, no sentence
I'm the statement, good riddance

Y'all better come my way
Y'all better come my way, okay, and say
Y'all better come my way
I'ma make a statement day by day

Y'all better come my way
Y'all better come my way, okay, and say
Y'all better come my way
I'ma make a statement day by day

Peace signs, peace signs up
Put 'em in the air, then go rise up (yeah)
Peace signs, peace signs up
Put 'em in the air, then go rise up (yeah)
Peace signs, peace signs up
Put 'em in the air, then go rise up (yeah)
Peace signs, peace signs up
Put 'em in the air, then go rise up (yeah)

Stand up, rise up
Peace signs up, now wassup? (Let's go!)
Stand up, rise up
Peace signs up, now wassup? (Let's go!)
Stand up, rise up
Peace signs up, now wassup? (Let's go!)

Live in a time of lost hope
We got no ropes for that down slope
We got many with plenty that say nope
We got refugees on broke boats
I'm like, "Huh"
Real life with no TV
Millionaires stay greedy
No love and there's no grub
We got the homeless saying, "Feed me"

Y'all better come my way
Y'all better come my way, okay, and say
Y'all better come my way
I'ma make a statement day by day

Y'all better come my way
Y'all better come my way, okay, and say
Y'all better come my way
I'ma make a statement day by day

Peace signs, peace signs up
Put 'em in the air, then go rise up (yeah)
Peace signs, peace signs up
Put 'em in the air, then go rise up (yeah)
Peace signs, peace signs up
Put 'em in the air, then go rise up (yeah)
Peace signs, peace signs up
Put 'em in the air, then go rise up (yeah)
